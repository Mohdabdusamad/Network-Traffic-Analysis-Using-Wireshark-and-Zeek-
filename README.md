# Network-Traffic-Analysis-Using-Wireshark-and-Zeek-
This project explores the analysis of network traffic using two powerful open-source tools: Wireshark and Zeek. Wireshark enables deep packet inspection and real-time visualization of network flows, while Zeek offers scalable, event-driven monitoring and detailed log generation.
